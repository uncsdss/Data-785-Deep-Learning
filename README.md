# Data 785: Deep Learning

Welcome to the repository for the **DATA 785: Deep Learning Live Sessions**. This space hosts the Jupyter notebooks used during live instruction. Each notebook corresponds to material covered in-session and is intended to support active participation, discussion, and follow-up.

These materials are not intended as standalone tutorials, but rather as references for those attending the sessions.

## Structure

Notebooks are organized by session and will be added over time as the course progresses.

## Contact

For questions about these materials or sessions, feel free to reach out:
